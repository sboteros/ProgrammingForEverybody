## Using functions

+ Store and reuse steps.
+ A function is an stored code that we use.
+ An *argument* is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the functions. We put the arguments into parenthesis after the name of the
function.
+ Built-in functions. You should treat the names of built-in functions as
reserved words.
    - `max()`: returns the largest value in a list.
    - `min()`: returns the smallest value in a list.
    - `len()`: returns the number of items in its argument.
    - Type conversion functions: `int()` (can convert floating-point values to
    integers, but it doesn't round up), `float()` (converts integers and
    strings to floating-point numbers), and `str()` (converts its argument to
    a string).
    - Math module
        * Import: `import math`
        * To call a function you specify the name of the module and the name of
        the functions, separated by a period.
        * `math.log10` (base 10 logarithm), `math.log` (natural logarithm),
        `math.sin`, `math.pi` ($\pi$ aproximate at about 15 digits),
        `math.pow(a, b)` ($a^b$), `math.sqrt()` (squared root).
    - Random numbers.
        * Import: `import random` (provides functions that generate
        *pseudorandom*) numbers.
        * `random.ramdom()`: returns a random float, $0.0 \leq x < 1.0$.
        * `random.randint(low, high)`: returns randmon integers,
        $low \leq x \leq high$.
        * `random.choice(vector)`: randomly selects an element from the vector.
        * There are distributions: Gaussian, exponential, gamma, etc.

## Defining functions

+ A *function definition* specifies the name of a new function and the
sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.
+ Example
    ```
    def thing() :       # Header
        print('Hello')  # Body
        print('Fun')

    thin()
    print('Zip')
    thing()
    ```
+ You can't use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid
having a variable and a function with the same name.
+ A *parameter* is a variable which we use in the function definition. It is a
'handle' that allows the code in the function to access the arguments for a
particular function invocation.
    ```
    def greet(lang) :
        if lang == 'es' :
            print('Hola')
        elif lang == 'fr' :
            print('Bonjour')
        else :
            print('Hello')
    ```

+ The `return` statement is used to pick the value to be used as the value of
the function call in the calling expression. It (1) stops the function, and
(2) determines the residual value.
    ```
    def greet()
        return "Hello"
    ```

+ Example
    ```
    def addtwo(a, b)
            added = a + b
            return added
    ```

+ Why creating functions:
    - Naming a group of statements, and making the program easier to read,
    understand, and debug.
    - Simplifying the program by eliminating repetitive code.
    - Simplifying debugging.
    - Useful code for more than one program.
