## Conditional statement

+ Example 1
    ```
    x = 5
    if x < 10 :
        print('Smaller')
    if x > 20 :
        print('Bigger')

    print('Finis')
    ```

+ Example 2
    ```
    x = 5
    if x < 6 : print('Less than 6')
    ```
+ Recommendend indent: 4 spaces.
    - Python can be confused if sometimes you use tab and other put spaces.
    - Put tab off in your editor and turn it to spaces!
    - Atom automatically uses spaces for files with `.py` extension!
+ Boolean expressions:
    - *Comparisson operators*: `<`, `<=`, `==`, `>=`, `>`, `!=`, `is`, and
    `is not`.
    - *Logical operators*: `and`, `or`, and `not`
+ In Python, indenting matters. It's more important in Python than in
practically any other language.

+ Example 3
    ```
    x = 4
    if x > 2 :
        print('Bigger')
    else :
        print('Smaller')

    print('All done')
    ```

+ Example 4
    ```
    if x < 2 :
        print('small')
    elif x < 10 :
        print('Medium')
    else :
        print('LARGE')
    print('All done')
    ```

+ `try` and `except`: this is a way to eliminate or catch tracebacks.
    - If the code in the `try` works, the `except` is skipped.

+ Example 5
    ```
    astr = 'Hello Bob'
    try :
        istr = int(astr)
    except :
        istr = -1
    print('First', istr)

    astr = '123'
    try :
        istr = int(astr)
    except :
        istr = -1
    print('Second', istr)
    ```

+ Ocassionaly it is useful to have a body with no statemets (usually as a
place holder for code you haven't written yet).
    ```
    if x < 0 :
        pass    # need to handle negative values!
    ```
