## Loops and iteration

+ Loops have *iteration variables* that change each time through a loop. Often
these *iteration variable* go through a sequence of numbers.
    ```
    n = 5
        while n > 0 :
        print(n)
        n = n - 1
    print('Blastoff!')
    print(1)
    ```

+ The `break` statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement
immediately following the loop.
    ```
    while True :
        line = input('> ')
        if line == 'done' :
            break
        print(line)
    print('Done!')
    ```

+ The `continue` statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of
the loop and starts the next iteration.
    ```
    while True :
        line = input('> ')
        if line[0] == '#' :
            continue
        if line == 'done' :
            break
        print(line)
    print('Done!')
    ```

## Definite loops

+ Definit loops have explicit *iteration variables* that change each time
through a loop. These *iteration variables* move through the sequence or set.

+ Example
    ```
    for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
        print(i)
    print('Blastoff!')
    ```

+ Example
    ```
    friends = ['Eliza', 'James', 'Laura']
    for friend in friends :
        print('Happy New Year:', friend)
    print('Done!')
    ```

## Finding the largest value

+ Idea:
```
    # Set some variables to initial values
    for thing in data :
        # Look for something or do something to each entry separately, updating
        # a variable.
    # Look at the variables.
```

+ Largest number
    ```
    numbers = [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15]
    largest_so_far = None
    print('Before', largest_so_far)
    for the_num in numbers :
        if largest_so_far is None or the_num > largest_so_far :
            largest_so_far = the_num
        print('Loop:', the_num, largest_so_far)

    print('Largest:', largest_so_far)
    ```
